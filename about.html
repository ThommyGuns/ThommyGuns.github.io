      <p>I have recently graduated from St. Bonaventure University with a Bachelors of Science, Magna Cum Laude, in Computer Science. I also received both the Computer Science Achievement and the Computer Science Service award upon graduating.</p>
      <br><p>Currently, I am working as a programming intern for Cutco Corporation. I work under the direct marketing team, mainly programming in RPG Free and SQL in our AS/400 system. However, the position is temporary so I am on the job hunt for a full-time software developer position. My ideal position would be front-end developer working with either Java or C#, HTML, CSS, and Javascript technologies. I have experience developing in all, and am a great problem solver.<p>
      <br><p>I grew up in the small town of Gowanda, New York, where I attended Gowanda High School. I didn't know that I wanted to be a programmer until I started classes at St. Bonaventure. After I began playing around coding, I found out the vast possibilites and fell in love with it. I enjoy learning new things, especially coding related.<p>

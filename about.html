      <p>I have recently graduated from St. Bonaventure University with a Bachelors of Science, Magna Cum Laude, in Computer Science. I also received both the Computer Science Achievement and the Computer Science Service award upon graduating.</p>
      <br><p>Currently, I am working in Cleveland, Ohio as a Software Engineer at AmTrust Financial. We mostly are programming in the Visual Basic language using Visual Studio for our environment. The main duties involve fixing issues in the current system that end users may experience. Also, much time is spent trying to optimize our current system to operate more smoothly and efficient.<p>
      <br><p>I grew up in the small town of Gowanda, New York, where I attended Gowanda High School. I didn't know that I wanted to be a programmer until I started classes at St. Bonaventure. After I began playing around coding, I found out the vast possibilites and fell in love with it. I enjoy learning new things, especially coding related.<p>

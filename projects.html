        <p >One of my current projects is remaking the website for Eade Fitness, a gym located in Olean, NY. The current site is old, cluttered and not mobile-friendly. This redesign will be using Twitter Bootstrap in collaboration with the Jekyll Framework. I am also researching CloudCannon, a hosting site and CMS that allows for non-technical users to make changes to the site.  </p>

        <div class="well body-text">
        <p>I also enjoy playing around with the Android SDK and creating apps in my free time. However, I have not got to publishing any of them. My most extensive one at the moment is an app designed for the Computer Science department at St. Bonaventure. It includes various details about the department, as well as features dealing with the YouTube and Google Maps API. I originally began creating this application a couple years ago, so the code is dated. I would like to revisit this project, bring it up to date, and eventually ship it to the market.  </p>
